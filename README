1. Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline:

The Jenkins pipelines builds the Docker images for two Python microservices and deploys them to AWS ECS.

Steps to Run Jenkins:

Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository containing the Dockerfile and the Jenkinsfiles.
Set Up Jenkins:

Install the necessary plugins: Docker Pipeline, Git, Pipeline.
Add AWS credentials in Jenkins under Manage Jenkins â†’ Manage Credentials

a. Create a Jenkins Pipeline Job for the CI pipeline:
Create a new Pipeline Job in Jenkins.
In the Pipeline Definition, select Pipeline script from SCM and provide the GitHub repository URL.
Trigger the CI Pipeline:

The Jenkins CI pipeline will:
Checkout the code
Build the Docker images for the microservices.
Push the Docker images to ECR.

b. Create a Jenkins Pipeline Job for the CD pipeline:
Create a new Pipeline Job in Jenkins.
In the Pipeline Definition, select Pipeline script from SCM and provide the GitHub repository URL.

After the CI pipeline builds and pushes the Docker images, the CD pipeline will:
Create new version to the task definition and update the service with the new reviosion of the task definition.

2. Terraform Infrastructure:

Terraform provisions AWS resources: ECS cluster, S3 bucket, SQS queue and VPC.

Navigate to the Terraform Directory:

cd Terraform

Initialize Terraform: Initialize Terraform to download the necessary providers and modules.

cd workspace/dev/vpc
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

cd workspace/dev/ecs
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

cd workspace/dev/s3
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

cd workspace/dev/sqs
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

VPC
An ECS cluster running on Fargate.
Two ECS services, one for each microservice.
An S3 bucket for storing files.
An SQS queue for message queuing.
IAM roles and security groups for ECS and other resources.
